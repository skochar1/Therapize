# Therapy App

A widespread problem for students is finding a proper mental health professional for their needs. School mental health resources often do not provide enough support, and are overburdened by the amount of students. Several of students are deterred from even attempting to go to therapy because of the amount of time it takes to find a therapist that fit their needs (ex. monetary issues, insurance accepted or not, availability to accept new clients, specialties on specific mental health issues, figuring out if they are a “fit”). We have designed an app that helps users find mental health professionals that meet their needs quickly.

Target demographic: High-school juniors and seniors, and all undergraduate students

UI Guidelines:
* Non-overwhelming UI (users are already stressed and time is at a premium); calm colors (lavender, for instance)
* Use colors, icons, etc. to promote an encouraging mindset among users who are feeling stressed 
* Enhance user convenience by making all crucial interactions require as few steps as possible.
* Give an option to increase font size for users with visibility impairments
* Choose colors that allow users with color-blindness to still have a calming experience
